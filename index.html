                As coffee is often grown in mountainous areas, widespread use of mechanical harvesters is not 
                possible and the ripe coffee cherries are usually picked by hand. The main exception is Brazil, 
                where the relatively flat landscape and immense size of the coffee fields allow for machinery use.
                Coffee trees yield an average of 2 to 4 kilos of cherries and a good picker can harvest 45 to 90 
                kilos of coffee cherry per day; this will produce nine to 18 kilos of coffee beans. Coffee is 
                harvested in one of two ways: 1) Strip picked – all the cherries are stripped off of the branch at 
                one time, either by machine or by hand 2) Selectively picked – only the ripe cherries are harvested 
                and they are picked by hand.

                A coffee bean is a seed of the Coffea plant and the source for coffee. It is the pip inside 
                the red or purple fruit often referred to as a coffee cherry. Just like ordinary cherries, the 
                coffee fruit is also a so-called stone fruit. Even though the coffee beans are not technically 
                beans, they are referred to as such because of their resemblance to true beans. The fruits; 
                cherries or berries, most commonly contain two stones with their flat sides together. A small 
                percentage of cherries contain a single seed, instead of the usual two. This is called a 
                "peaberry". The peaberry occurs only between 10% and 15% of the time, and it is a fairly common 
                (yet scientifically unproven) belief that they have more flavour than normal coffee beans.

                Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain 
                flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a 
                stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms 
                them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are 
                typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.

                Although all types of coffee begin with coffee beans, the drink can be brewed using different kinds
                of equipment. Many countries also have traditional methods of brewing the drink, to which varying 
                ratios of liquids and flavorings can be added. The mix and match of brewing methods, flavors, and 
                drinking traditions mean that there exist a zillion types of coffees in the world, of which this 
                list explains some of the most common ones.
